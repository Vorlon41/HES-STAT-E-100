# STAT E - 100 Mission 3

```{r}
# Input the dataset
housing = read_excel("C:/Users/User/Desktop/HarvardExtensionSchool/Stat E 100/Mission 3/Housing.xlsx")
```
## 1.	Generate a table of proportions with the variable airconditioning on one axis, and hotwaterheating on the other axis. Set the margins as TRUE. Paste the R code and the output from R.

```{r}
contingency_table = table(housing$airconditioning, housing$hotwaterheating)
dimnames(contingency_table) <- list(
  AirConditioning = c("No", "Yes"), 
  HotWaterHeating = c("No", "Yes")   
)
proportions_table = prop.table(contingency_table) * 100
proportions_with_margins = addmargins(proportions_table)
print(proportions_with_margins)
```
## 2.	From the table from question 1, report the value for the following:
P(no air conditioning and no hot water heating) = **64.1 % (.640366972)**

## 3.	Generate a table of counts that has furnishingstatus on one axis, and airconditioning on another axis. Set the margins as TRUE. Include the R code and output from R.
```{r}
count_table <- table(housing$furnishingstatus, housing$airconditioning)

dimnames(count_table) = list(
  FurnishingStatus = unique(housing$furnishingstatus),  
  AirConditioning = unique(housing$airconditioning)     
)
count_with_margins = addmargins(count_table)
print(count_with_margins)
```
## 4.	For the output from question 3, calculate the following:
P(has air conditioning | furnished) = **78/140 (furnished with air / total furnished) which is 55.7% (0.55714286)**

## 5.	For the output from question 3, calculate the following:
P(has air conditioning | unfurnished) = **133/177 (unfurnished with air / total unfurnished) which is 74.7 (0.7419101)**

## 6 Determine using the data set whether the probability of a house having air conditioning and whether it is furnished are independent events. Show any calculations that lead up to the decision of whether the two events are dependent or independent.

## 7. Calculate the following probabilities:
### P(pass second test and pass first test) = **0.56**
### P(pass second test and fail first test) = **0.18**
### P(fail second test and pass first test) = **0.14**
### P(fail second test and fail first test) = **0.12**
### What do the four probabilities above add up to? **1**
